/**
 * The chrome drawn over the content: the selection box and its handles, the band a drag sweeps out,
 * the lasso loop.
 *
 * All of it is built as ordinary triangles and pushed through the same transient buffer the wet
 * stroke uses, rather than through a shader of its own. That keeps one path for everything the
 * canvas draws, and the two are never needed at once: you cannot be inking and selecting.
 *
 * Widths arrive in device pixels and are divided by the zoom here, so the outline stays one
 * thickness however far in or out the canvas is. That means the overlay has to be rebuilt when the
 * view changes, which is cheap: it is a few dozen triangles.
